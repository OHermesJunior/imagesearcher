Reverse Image Searcher allows you to search images from your phone in multiple search engines at the same time!
It is an open source, ad free and has a modern UI.

It uploads your image to https://transfer.sh/ (a FLOSS anonymous file sharing server) which will be deleted after a day.
The image will be sent to Google, Bing and Yandex search engines by default, but this can be configured on the settings.
